## Prelude

On a small dinghy, wandering off from it's mother ship, Toby and Nicole paddle their way in the direction of South West.
Happy, their trusty golden retriever, sits between them on the dinghy.
South West towards an island that, according to legend, has crystal clear waters, and has crops and fruits in abundance.

The perfect getaway spot. But also the home of an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh's treasures.
The island is rumored to be hidden from the outside world and only with the map can it be found.

Many have gone shipwrecked trying to find it. But none before have had what Toby and Nicole have.
After Toby, an experienced archeologist, completed excavating the ruined Fort Rachid near the town of Rosetta at the mouth of the Nile, he found a black basalt slab.
After deciphering the hieroglyphics, Nicole, who was well versed in the art of ancient symbols and mappings, discovered that it was a story of the lost island.

Hidden in the story were clues on how to get to the island. Together, Toby and Nicole put together a map.

A map to the legendary island.

## Introduction

According to the map they should be a few hundred meters away now.

While on the dinghy, Toby notices the water begins to stir. He pays little mind to it until he notices the clouds begin to cover the blue sky.
"Odd" Toby thinks. According to the weather report it should have been clear skies all day.

A few minutes later Nicole stops paddling."Do you think a storm is coming?" she asks.

Toby, wondering the same, replies casually "Nah, weatherman said clear skies. Must just be a few passing clouds." He's too close to go back now.

Happy barks, somewhat cautiously.

Nicole paddles on, with a touch of haste now. Toby follows suit.

"Shouldn't be far now" Toby says.

Then, seconds later, the clouds grow dark and Toby feels the boat rock too and fro with the waves that have now formed from the still water.

Toby and Nicole both know that if a storm does come it will be the end for them. They pick up the pace.

Almost in sync with this new haste, the waves begin to pick up and rain begins to fall. The dinghy is slowly filling up and the paddles are moving at full throttle.

Happy circles the dinghy fearfully, barking at the ocean, almost asking it to calm down.

The rain introduces a full on thunderstorm and seconds into the storm Toby and Nicole and Happy are all whipped up by a wave hitting the boat and flipping it over.

They're in the water now but the waves keep them under.

The blue skies, turned gray now fade into black as they are sink down into the depths of the ocean.

## Opening Scene

themselves washed up on shore. They find a note placed between them
depicting what looks to be a dog above a temple. the dog looks to be dead perhaps
a sacrifice of some sort, Toby and Nicole look confused and that's when it hits them
 " where's Happy" Toby exclaims, that's when panic sets in- Happy is missing.
